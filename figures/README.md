# Figure exports

- `figure_1_headline_four_model_comparison.*`
- `figure_2_gpt_estimator_robustness.*`
- `figure_3_claude_estimator_robustness.*`
- `figure_4_ttft_extrapolation_primary.*`

Each figure is provided as a 240 dpi PNG, SVG, and PDF. All twelve files are
generated directly from the committed observations and fit tables by:

```bash
make figures
```

The neutral exports contain no organizational logo, website asset, or branded
footer. They retain the models, observations, fits, scales, titles, and
extrapolation specifications used in the report figures.

## Astra API supplement

`astra-api/astra_api_student_t.{png,svg,pdf}` is a separate single-model figure
using all 24 September 9 Astra API measurements and their Student-t quadratic fit.
It follows the same neutral styling and uses no additional assets. Run
`make astra` to refit and render, or `make astra-figures` to render from the
committed tables. See [`docs/astra-api.md`](../docs/astra-api.md) for provenance
and the treatment of the interrupted initial session and excluded setup requests.

## Sol API comparison supplement

`sol-api/four_model_api_robustness_with_minimum_floor_2x2_titled.{png,svg,pdf}`
is a separate API-only 114-observation comparison, not a replacement for Figure 1.
See [scope and reproduction](../docs/sol-api.md); regenerate with
`make sol-api-figures`. PNG is 240 dpi. SVG and PDF retain vector geometry.
No organizational logo, branded footer, or private website assets are embedded.
